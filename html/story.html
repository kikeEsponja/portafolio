                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 1</h4></a>
                <p id="cap1">My work journey has been quite varied since I entered the job market at the age of 18. At that time, I only wanted to be a rock star, but money was needed for that, so I quickly prepared a resume and submitted it to different places. A supermarket named Fiorca hired me as a cashier despite my lack of experience. I worked there for nearly a year, serving customers. It was my responsibility to manage the money coming in and going out of the cash register in accordance with the sold merchandise. Sometimes, the lines were long, and there was no time for small talk, leading to occasional mistakes, which were, of course, deducted from the employee's account. My computer skills allowed me to quickly learn how to operate the cash register and sales software. One day, the board of supervisors changed, and so did the treatment towards the employees, which had already been quite unfriendly. I didn't stay there much longer, seizing the opportunity to explore new horizons.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 2</h4></a>
                <p id='cap2'>I joined an auto parts sales store specializing in Chevrolet and its affiliates, serving both as a cashier and a sales executive. In the latter role, I had a position that was a bit closer to administration than a typical cashier. The job involved assisting customers, guiding them in their requirements until they found the specific auto part they were looking for, as many were not exactly sure of what they needed. I quickly learned to navigate the software and search for products in the database, which I had to ensure was up-to-date, despite having a certain level of automation. The pay was good, slightly above the minimum, and there were sales commissions, providing an incentive to focus on that aspect. As part of the job, I also performed simple installations of some parts if the customer required it, after offering the service, of course. I stayed there for a year until I found a better offer with a higher position in terms of both compensation and responsibilities.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 3</h4></a>
                <p id="cap3">It was at a construction company that also engaged in real estate sales, called Constructora y Urbanizadora Morle C.A. (Morle Construction and Urbanization, if it still exists), where I worked as a sales executive responsible for closing real estate deals. In this role, my responsibilities included showcasing the properties to potential clients and convincing or persuading them to finalize the deal. If successful, clients would then proceed to the offices for the necessary paperwork. It was a relatively straightforward job that offered generous sales commissions, much more than my previous employment, considering that a property costs significantly more than even the most expensive auto part for the priciest vehicles. I worked there for two years, during which I learned many aspects of the business and administration itself—lessons I wouldn't have acquired at university by any means. By this time, I had already let go of the dream of having a rock band, but I never stopped buying instruments and playing purely as a hobby. It was only a matter of time before I spontaneously joined forces with others who played music, forming a musical group. It was at one of our performances at a friend's house that I was approached by an employee of an oil company who happened to be there. He spoke to me about a job opening in his sector, mentioning that the only requirements were knowing how to drive manual transmission cars and being proficient in English.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 4</h4></a>
                <p id="cap4">I immediately accepted and went to work in the field with CNPC Services LTD, where despite the challenges associated with the job, I stayed for seven years. It was a stable job, and the benefits it offered were significantly better than other positions. It involved a 7-days-on, 7-days-off schedule—I would leave home on a Thursday at six in the morning and return the following Thursday at the same time. CNPC stands for China National Petroleum Company, so my superiors were from the Far East, the land of rice and kung fu. The job primarily required me to serve as a translator at all times for the drill executives, ensuring effective communication with the staff. This proved to be quite a challenge as they, the Chinese (those particular Chinese), did not have a complete mastery of English pronunciation. My initial expectations of conversing with them in English were shattered in the first moment. However, I learned to communicate with them to convey their messages to the local staff, who, unfortunately for me, didn't understand a word of English. Aside from that, it became a routine. Seven years later, the government could no longer sustain the country's economy, leading to many changes—changes for the worse. The salary became increasingly inadequate, and one day I realized that I could no longer cover my expenses. If I didn't make a quick move, I would be trapped forever in a vicious cycle of unproductive work just to survive day by day.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 5</h4></a>
                <p id="cap5">I tried to increase my income with an entrepreneurial venture renting out computers for gaming and other activities. I rented a space near a high school and set up twelve computers. Word spread quickly, and in less than a week, I found myself facing a thriving business. I adorned it by adding a DVD movie rental service, which also grew rapidly, doubling my income in no time. I didn't want to stop there; I saw every space as an opportunity to generate extra income. This included helping others do the same. I immediately asked a friend if he wanted to earn some extra money and bought products in bulk, which I sold in my store, and we shared the profits. Without realizing it, the business transformed into a company, even expanding to sell musical instruments. Several people expressed interest in investing in my business for additional income. I made contact with an importer selling the most unconventional products I had ever seen. Initially, I was afraid to make the first purchase, but the products had an unexpectedly positive reception. Everything was going so well that the business began to demand more of my time, leading me to the decision to leave my job at CNPC. Now, I could dedicate myself entirely to something that was mine. However, one day, calamity struck.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 6</h4></a>
                <p id="cap6">I was robbed and stripped of my belongings by a gang of thieves who left the place in such a state that, after a whole day of calculating and adjusting numbers, I wouldn't be able to recover for years. Considering the risk of another robbery if the business bounced back, I decided to abandon everything. I sold everything I could to start something new. Thinking that the fruit and vegetable business wouldn't attract criminals, I took that path, donning the appropriate attire: a straw hat, sandals, and inconspicuous clothing. If the previous business had flourished quickly, this one did so in half the time. However, I was once again surprised by thieves who, although only taking the money I had on hand (as I made a point to deposit the bulk in the bank up to five times a day), managed to further damage my already wounded morale. I sold everything I could and bought a plane ticket to Ecuador, where I purchased furniture for a small restaurant that also met a dismal fate.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 7</h4></a>
                <p id="cap7">My lack of knowledge about Ecuadorian gastronomy and the country's economy led to the spectacular failure of what could have been a luxurious restaurant. I thought my previous successes would be replicated and sustained over time, given the low crime rate in the northern area of Quito. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I didn't give up and tried again, only to achieve an even worse result. I also attempted to find employment, any job, but I collided abruptly with the wall of xenophobia. I then took what little money and dignity I had left and returned to Venezuela, only to be filled with terror by what I found. Without delving into details of the misery and hardships that, by this point, the entire world knows, I decided to spend what little I had left and ventured to Argentina. This time, it was a bit more challenging due to the restrictions imposed by the government in response to the mass exodus of Venezuelans worldwide.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 8</h4></a>
                <p id="cap8">Once in Argentina, I started distributing my resume everywhere until I finally received responses from a car wash. I no longer had the money I arrived in Ecuador with, and the cost of the ticket to Argentina was so high that I depended solely on what I could earn to pay for accommodation and food. That's why the car wash offered to pay me on a daily basis, a proposal to which I gladly agreed. Six months later, I was able to stabilize a bit and realize that this job barely left me half a day to rest and continue the rest of the week. This was not to mention that I genuinely needed time to find a better job. So, I left the car wash to work in a restaurant.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 9</h4></a>
                <p id="cap9">Washing dishes against the clock, cleaning floors, and tidying bathrooms, among other tasks, left my body exhausted at the end of the day. The pay was slightly better than at the car wash, but the work was more demanding. I thought that if I stayed there for much longer, I would never get ahead. So, after much consideration, I also resigned after eight months. Finding a job in the city of Buenos Aires is not that simple; you just have to persevere. That's how I ended up meeting a builder who offered me a job as his assistant. The pay was considerably higher, and the work was not as physically taxing as it might seem. I felt a bit better there, and I was also learning a trade. However, then I discovered the delivery app, and everything changed.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 10</h4></a>
                <p id="cap10">At first, it didn't seem like something that would last, but it was worth a try. So, I bought a cheap bicycle and, without giving up on masonry, activated my account and waited for them to 'call me.' The glory: 'my first order!' The disaster: 'I spilled it when I fell off the bike.' I got up, wiped the slate clean, and tried again. Soon, I adapted to the system, and it seemed like such a good thing not to have a fixed work schedule or a boss constantly peering over my shoulder, questioning me. I left masonry to focus on delivery. It paid much less, but freedom is priceless. However, I quickly fell into the clutches of the most demanding and unforgiving boss I know: myself. In the pursuit of increasing my income, I found myself working on the bicycle for up to twelve hours a day. I justified it as I was working near my home, so I continued working hard until I saved enough to buy a motorcycle, which significantly eased the workload. If I thought it was easy on a bicycle, it was twice as easy on a motorcycle. So, as soon as I could, I bought a larger and faster motorcycle.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 11</h4></a>
                <p id="cap11">Then came the pandemic. COVID-19 took over the world, a global curfew that confined more than half of the planet to their homes. Fortunately, delivery had a free pass to operate, so I could maintain my income compared to the significant number of people who saw their jobs diminished due to the unusual martial law. So, without stopping work, I ventured day and night through the deserted streets to deliver food and medicines to hundreds of people confined in their homes. It took me three years to realize that I was wasting time and letting life slip away with the cheap excuse of freedom and security. I noticed that my life was passing by delivering food, and I didn't want to be a delivery person for the rest of my life. That's when an opportunity presented itself. I delivered an order to a technology business, showed interest in what they were doing, and after a quick assessment, the manager saw an opportunity and told me there was a vacancy (several, as many employees had 'left' due to the pandemic). I gladly accepted. It was a part-time job, so I could continue with my delivery work, adding money and skills. That's how I became a provider of IT equipment maintenance services, a skill I had acquired years ago and reinforced when I started my own cyber café.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 12</h4></a>
                <p id="cap12">Two attempted robberies were the incentive I needed to break free from the chains that bound me to delivery. I clearly saw that a third attempt was imminent, and this time they might succeed, not to mention the increasing risk to my life. So, with a heavy heart, I sold the two motorcycles that sustained my life and dedicated myself to finding another job, as a part-time one was not enough. I conveyed this to my boss, who then asked if I knew anything about software. I confidently replied yes, unaware that he was referring to the creation of software, not just using it. After clearing up the confusion and admitting that I had a fairly basic idea of programming but that my computer skills allowed me to learn quickly, I was invited to join an accelerated training team. I accepted without hesitation, and that marked the beginning of a journey that brought me to where I am now. Grateful to the universe for every new opportunity.</p>
                <a href="#indice"><h4 class="text-warning">Chapter 13</h4></a>
                <p id="cap13">Thankfully, the rest has been peace and tranquility, at least in the professional realm. I've learned to use various technologies, obtained multiple certifications, and I continue to pursue more. For various reasons, I didn't continue as an employee of Technosupply. Still, with the acquired knowledge, I joined a team as a QA tester to develop an e-commerce platform for a client in the women's hygiene product industry. Soon after, I transitioned to the development team, showcasing more skills in this area. After the completion of that project, I was recommended to participate in another where we developed an online gaming platform. Finally, I joined the company I'm in now, working on custom software and commissioned projects. I have a top-notch team and a winning attitude.</p>
